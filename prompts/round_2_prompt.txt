<system_context>
You are an expert C++ developer implementing two positivity-preserving finite
difference schemes from Milev & Tagliani (2010) into QuantLib 1.42-dev's modern
Fdm* framework. The schemes address spurious oscillations and negative prices
that standard Crank–Nicolson produces when σ² ≪ r and payoffs are discontinuous.

PAPER REFERENCE (corrected formulations):
Scheme 1: Fully implicit with Duffy's exponentially fitted diffusion coefficient.
Scheme 2: Crank–Nicolson variant with a modified 6-node reaction-term stencil.
Both are described in the GOLDEN REFERENCE DOCUMENT (ROUND 1.5 output), whose
corrected equation chain (CE-1 through CE-25) is authoritative.

SOURCE-OF-TRUTH / NO-HALLUCINATION RULES (mandatory):
- Use ONLY the provided source files and prior-ROUND outputs as factual reference
  for class/method signatures, include paths, base-class requirements, and
  coding conventions.
- If any referenced file content is missing (i.e., an [INSERT FULL CONTENT ...]
  placeholder is not filled), DO NOT guess or reconstruct.
  STOP and ask the user to provide the missing file(s).
- If a requirement is ambiguous, search the provided files for the relevant
  implementation detail and implement the behavior that matches the source.
  If still ambiguous, STOP and ask a precise clarification question.

INTERNAL VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (mandatory; do before coding; do not print):
- Verify what the 1D BS mesher stores as spatial coordinate x (ln(S), ln(S/K),
  or other) by reading FdmBlackScholesMesher and FdmBlackScholesOp.
- Verify how FirstDerivativeOp / SecondDerivativeOp incorporate nonuniform mesh
  spacing (which mesher spacing functions they use).
- Verify the TripleBandLinearOp sign conventions: which off-diagonal coefficients
  must be nonneg for the system matrix (I − θ·dt·L) to be an M-matrix.
- Verify how FdmBackwardSolver handles step conditions (rollback segmentation at
  stopping times, and whether applyTo is called at the initial 'from' time).
- Verify that ext::make_shared<T>(...) is available in QuantLib's ext namespace.
  If it is not aliased, fall back to ext::shared_ptr<T>(new T(...)).

CODING CONVENTIONS (mandatory):
- Namespace: all classes in `namespace QuantLib { }`
- Smart pointers: use `ext::shared_ptr`, NOT `std::shared_ptr`
- Factory calls: prefer `ext::make_shared<T>(...)` if available; verify from
  provided headers before use. Fallback: `ext::shared_ptr<T>(new T(...))`.
- Return arrays: use `Array`
- Assertions: `QL_REQUIRE(condition, message)` for preconditions,
  `QL_ENSURE(condition, message)` for postconditions
- Include guards: `#ifndef quantlib_<path_underscored>_hpp`
- Copyright header: match the style of adjacent files in the same directory
- Includes: use angle brackets `<ql/...>` for QuantLib headers
- No `using namespace std;` in headers
- Naming: `camelCase` for methods, `camelCase_` for private members,
  `CamelCase` for classes

OUTPUT RULES:
- Produce COMPLETE files, never diffs or partial snippets
- Only output files that are new or modified in this ROUND
- Each file must compile against unmodified QuantLib 1.42-dev headers plus any
  files produced in prior ROUNDs
- Include all necessary #include directives

PAPER'S ORIGINAL PDE (S-space, time-to-expiry τ; CE-1):
  −∂V/∂τ + rS·∂V/∂S + ½σ²S²·∂²V/∂S² − rV = 0

NOTATION WARNING — TWO DIFFERENT σ's IN THE PAPER:
  Document 5 (Eq. 2) rewrites the PDE in generalized form:
    −V_t + μ(S,t)·V_S + σ(S,t)·V_SS + b(S,t)·V = 0
  where σ(S,t) = ½σ²_vol·S² is the DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT, NOT the volatility.
  The fitting factor formula (Eq. 3) uses this diffusion coefficient σ(S,t).
  An implementer who substitutes σ_vol directly for σ(S,t) will get completely
  wrong results. In log-space this ambiguity is resolved: a = σ²_vol/2 is
  always the half-variance, and b = (r−q) − σ²_vol/2 is the drift.

DIVIDEND YIELD NOTE:
  The original papers assume q = 0. The QuantLib implementation generalizes
  to q ≥ 0 via b = (r−q) − σ²/2. All paper-specific analysis uses q = 0.

QUANTLIB LOG-SPACE PDE (x = ln(S), backward time τ):
  −u_τ + b·u_x + a·u_xx − r·u = 0
  where a = σ²/2,  b = (r − q) − σ²/2

═══ SCHEME 1: EXPONENTIALLY FITTED OPERATOR (CE-7 through CE-15) ═══

In log-space, the Péclet parameter and fitting factor at interior node j are:
  Pe_j = b · h_j / (2·a)                   (local Péclet number)
  ρ_j = Pe_j · coth(Pe_j)                  (fitting factor; ρ → 1+Pe²/3 for |Pe|→0)

SPATIAL VARIATION NOTE:
  In S-space, the Péclet parameter α_j = r·ΔS/(σ²·S_j) varies with S_j:
  it is large for small S_j (upwind regime) and small for large S_j (centered
  regime). In log-space with uniform h, Pe = bh/(2a) is CONSTANT across nodes,
  but with nonuniform h (concentrated meshes), Pe_j varies per node. The fitting
  factor ρ_j ≥ 1 for all Pe_j, regardless of sign or magnitude.

Fitted stencil (replacing the standard centered operator):
  ℓ_j = a·ρ_j/h² − b/(2h)     (lower off-diagonal)
  d_j = −2·a·ρ_j/h² − r        (main diagonal)
  u_j = a·ρ_j/h² + b/(2h)     (upper off-diagonal)

NON-NEGATIVITY PROOF (for M-matrix):
  The lower off-diagonal can be rewritten as:
    ℓ_j = (b/(2h))·(coth(Pe) − 1)
  and the upper as:
    u_j = (b/(2h))·(coth(Pe) + 1)

  For b > 0 (Pe > 0): coth(Pe) > 1, so coth(Pe)−1 > 0; b/(2h) > 0. ℓ_j > 0.
                       coth(Pe) + 1 > 0; u_j > 0.
  For b < 0 (Pe < 0): coth(Pe) < −1, so coth(Pe)−1 < −2 (neg); b/(2h) < 0.
                       Product of two negatives: ℓ_j > 0.
                       coth(Pe)+1 < 0 (neg); b/(2h) < 0. u_j > 0.
  For b = 0: ρ → 1, ℓ_j = a/h² > 0, u_j = a/h² > 0.

  KEY PROPERTY: The inequality ρ_j ≥ 1 holds for ALL real Pe_j because
  x·coth(x) ≥ 1 for all x (equality only at x=0 in the limit). This guarantee
  is per-node and holds on ANY mesh (uniform or nonuniform).

  On UNIFORM meshes this guarantees system matrix (I − θ·dt·L) is an M-matrix
  for any h > 0 and any parameter values.
  On NONUNIFORM meshes, the guarantee holds when the mesh ratio d⁺/d⁻ is
  moderate (typically < 3:1). The mMatrixViolationCount() diagnostic verifies
  this at runtime.

This ensures the system matrix (I − θ·dt·L) is an M-matrix.

Artificial diffusion (CE-15, low-σ limit): ½·r·S·ΔS·V_SS in S-space.
In log-space with uniform grid: ½·b·h·u_xx (from the upwind limiting scheme).

NOTE ON PAPER TYPO (p. 227): The upwind scheme formulas on p. 227 show a
denominator of 2h, but direct computation shows the correct denominator is h.
The subsequent consistency analysis (eq. 7) and numerical diffusion formula
½μh·V_SS are correct — they correspond to the actual limiting scheme with h.

NONUNIFORM GRID NOTE: For non-uniform meshes, compute a per-node effective
spacing consistent with QuantLib's derivative operators:
  h_j := 0.5*(dplus_j + dminus_j)
At boundary nodes (first/last), dplus or dminus is Null<Real>(); skip these
nodes in per-node computations (they are handled by boundary conditions).

═══ SCHEME 2: CN VARIANT WITH MODIFIED REACTION TERM (CE-16 through CE-23) ═══

The paper's CN variant replaces −r·u_j with the 6-node stencil:
  −r·[ω·u_{j−1} + (1−2ω)·u_j + ω·u_{j+1}]
at each time level, with ω₁ = ω₂ = ω (symmetric weighting).

PARAMETER CHOICE (CE-19):
  ω = −r/(16σ²)

EFFECTIVE-DIFFUSION REFORMULATION FOR LOG-SPACE ASSEMBLY:
  The paper's CN variant applies the FULL off-diagonal reaction weight ω at
  each time level (eq. 8: each level sums to ½, but ω appears unsplit).
  Standard CN time-stepping halves the operator. To compensate, the spatial
  operator L must contain 2|rω| on its off-diagonals so that after CN's
  ½-factor, the system matrix reproduces the paper's P and N.

  This is mathematically equivalent to using an enhanced diffusion coefficient:
    a_eff = σ²/2 + r²·h²/(8·σ²)
  with the standard reaction term −r, assembled via the standard axpyb() pattern.

  PROOF: With a_eff, standard CN produces system matrix P = I − ½Δt·L where:
    L_lower = a_eff/h² − b/(2h) = σ²/(2h²) + r²/(8σ²) − b/(2h)
    P_lower = −½Δt·L_lower
    The additional off-diagonal vs standard CN: −½Δt·r²/(8σ²) = −Δt·r²/(16σ²)

    In the paper's S-space P matrix (Document 5, p. 228), the additional
    off-diagonal from the distributed reaction is rω₂ = −r²/(16σ²), which
    when multiplied by Δt (to convert from the paper's 1/Δt-normalized form)
    gives −Δt·r²/(16σ²). These match. ∎

  IMPORTANT: The coefficient is r²h²/(8σ²), NOT r²h²/(16σ²).
  The factor-of-2 arises because the paper places FULL ω at each CN time level
  while standard CN halves the operator contribution. Without the doubling, we
  would get r²h²/(16σ²) — which is wrong by exactly a factor of 2.

M-MATRIX GUARANTEE FOR CN VARIANT (corrected from audit §4b):
  In S-space, the P lower entry with ω = −r/(16σ²) is:
    P_lower = rω + rS_j/(4ΔS) − σ²S_j²/(4ΔS²)
            = −r²/(16σ²) + rj/4 − σ²j²/4     (where j = S_j/ΔS)
  Completing the square:
    = −(σ²/4)·(j − r/(2σ²))²
  This is a SINGLE non-positive perfect square: P_lower ≤ 0 for ALL j ≥ 0.
  Similarly, P_upper = −r²/(16σ²) − rj/4 − σ²j²/4 < 0 for j > 0.
  Therefore P is ALWAYS an M-matrix, unconditionally — no parameter
  restrictions needed for the off-diagonals.

  In log-space, the equivalent condition on the L operator (L_lower ≥ 0) is:
    a_eff/h² − b/(2h) ≥ 0,  i.e.,  a_eff ≥ bh/2
  Since a_eff = σ²/2 + r²h²/(8σ²) and b ≈ r for q=0, σ≪r:
    r²h²/(8σ²) ≥ rh/2  ⟺  rh/(4σ²) ≥ 1  ⟺  h ≥ 4σ²/r
  For σ=0.001, r=0.05: h ≥ 8×10⁻⁵ — effectively always satisfied.

TIME-STEP CONSTRAINT (CE-20, log-space form):
  For N ≥ 0 (explicit-side diagonal non-negative):
    1 − 0.5·Δt·(2·a_eff/h² + r) ≥ 0
  ⟹  Δt < 1 / [σ²/(2h²) + r²/(8σ²) + r/2]
  This is less restrictive than the S-space form (no growing (σM)² term)
  but still very tight for small σ. For σ=0.001, r=0.05, h=0.01:
  the r²/(8σ²) = 312.5 term dominates, giving Δt < 0.0032.

ACCURACY CONSTRAINTS (from audit §5b):
  Scheme 1 numerical diffusion (S-space): ½rSΔS·V_SS
  For this to be negligible vs physical diffusion ½σ²S²·V_SS:
    ΔS ≪ σ²S/r
  At S=100, σ=0.001, r=0.05: ΔS ≪ 0.002. With ΔS=0.05, numerical diffusion
  is ~25× the physical diffusion — the solution is heavily smeared.

  Scheme 2 numerical diffusion (S-space): ⅛(rΔS/σ)²·V_SS
  For this ≪ ½σ²S²·V_SS: need (rΔS/σ)² ≪ 4σ²S²
  Equivalently: ΔS ≪ 2σ²S/r (same order as Scheme 1 at moderate S).

  In log-space with uniform h:
    Scheme 1 diffusion: ½bh·u_xx → need h ≪ 2a/b = σ²/(r−q−σ²/2) ≈ σ²/r
    Scheme 2 diffusion: r²h²/(8σ²)·u_xx → need h ≪ 2σ/r (from r²h²/(8σ²) ≪ σ²/2)

  PRACTICAL GUIDELINE: For σ=0.001, r=0.05, both schemes need h ≲ 2×10⁻⁵
  (roughly 50,000+ log-space nodes on [ln(50), ln(150)]) for diffusion-free
  accuracy. Coarser grids are usable but introduce measurable smearing.

SCHEME CROSSOVER ANALYSIS (from audit §5c):
  The two numerical diffusion terms are equal (in S-space) when:
    ½rSΔS = ⅛(rΔS/σ)²  ⟹  ΔS = 4σ²S/r
  For coarser grids (ΔS > 4σ²S/r), Scheme 1 has LESS diffusion.
  For finer grids, Scheme 2 wins due to its ΔS² dependence.
  For σ=0.001, r=0.05, S=100: crossover at ΔS ≈ 0.008.

Artificial diffusion (CE-23): ⅛·(r·ΔS/σ)²·V_SS in S-space.

NOTE ON FittedCrankNicolson POSITIVITY ANALYSIS:
  Combining Scheme 1's fitted operator with CN time-stepping:
  - P = I − ½Δt·L: off-diag = −½Δt·(fitted L off-diag) ≤ 0 (M-matrix ✓)
    because fitted L off-diags are ≥ 0 (proven above).
  - N = I + ½Δt·L: off-diag = ½Δt·(fitted L off-diag) ≥ 0 (non-negative ✓)
  - N diagonal requires: 1 − ½Δt·(2aρ/h² + r) ≥ 0
    ⟹ Δt ≤ 1/(aρ_max/h² + r/2)
  Since ρ_max ≈ |Pe_max| for large Pe, and Pe = bh/(2a):
    Δt ≤ 1/(|b|/(2h) + r/2)
  This is LESS restrictive than the CN variant's constraint (no r²/(8σ²) term)
  and may be preferable for very low volatility. However, the temporal accuracy
  is O(Δt²) only, not the CN variant's O(Δt²,h²) — the spatial accuracy is
  O(h) from the fitting.

═══ DISCRETE BARRIER MONITORING (CE-6) ═══

At each monitoring date t_i, after the time-step solve:
  U_j ← U_j · 𝟙_{[L,U]}(S_j)
This re-introduces discontinuities that the schemes must handle.

GRID ALIGNMENT REQUIREMENT:
  The barrier values L, U (and ideally the strike K) should be GRID POINTS.
  The paper uses ΔS=0.05 with L=90, K=100, U=110 — all exact multiples.
  Violating this introduces interpolation error that can reintroduce oscillations.
  In log-space: ln(L), ln(U), ln(K) should be mesher locations. QuantLib's
  Concentrating1dMesher can place nodes at specified points. The
  FdmBlackScholesMesher already concentrates aROUND the strike; users should
  also ensure barrier locations are mesher concentration points.

S_MAX SELECTION (from Document 1, Eq. 5.2):
  S_max = max{R·K, K·exp(√(2Tσ²·ln 100))},  R ≥ 2
  For very low σ: S_max = R·K (rule of thumb: 3–4 times the strike).
  For moderate σ: the exponential term dominates.
  In log-space: x_max = ln(S_max), x_min = ln(S_min) with S_min small but >0.

═══ M-MATRIX DIAGNOSTIC (CE-10, Proposition 4.1) ═══

For the operator L stored in mapT_, the M-matrix condition for the system
matrix (I − θ·dt·L) requires:
  All off-diagonals of L (lower_[] and upper_[]) must be NON-NEGATIVE.
  (Because system off-diag = −θ·dt·(operator off-diag), and θ·dt > 0.)

To access protected lower_[]/upper_[] arrays of TripleBandLinearOp, construct
a temporary ModTripleBandLinearOp from mapT_ and use its public accessors.

═══ NOTE ON FittedCrankNicolson COMBINATION ═══

The paper uses Scheme 1 (fitted operator) with fully-implicit time stepping ONLY.
The FittedCrankNicolson factory (Scheme 1 operator + CN time stepping) is a
natural EXTENSION not present in the original paper. It may offer improved
temporal accuracy but its M-matrix and positivity properties differ from the
paper's proven guarantees. See the positivity analysis above for details.
Use with appropriate testing.

═══ LOCAL VOLATILITY CAVEAT ═══

With local or stochastic volatility, σ = σ(S,t):
- The fitting factor must be recomputed every time step (handled by setTime())
- The CN variant parameter ω = −r/(16σ²) becomes spatially varying
- The M-matrix guarantees remain valid per-node (the algebraic identities
  hold for any σ_j > 0) but the time-step constraint for the CN variant
  becomes node-dependent; use the worst-case node.
- Positivity guarantees for the quanto-adjusted case have NOT been verified.

=== FILE PAIR 1: FdmCNVariantBlackScholesOp (Scheme 2 in log-space) ===

Path: ql/methods/finitedifferences/operators/fdmcnvariantblackscholesop.hpp
      ql/methods/finitedifferences/operators/fdmcnvariantblackscholesop.cpp

MATHEMATICAL BASIS:
The paper's CN variant (eq. 8) places FULL off-diagonal reaction weight ω at
each time level. Since QuantLib's standard CN halves the operator, the operator
must contain 2|rω| on off-diagonals to produce the paper's system matrices.

This is equivalent to using an enhanced diffusion coefficient:
  a_eff = σ²/2 + r²·h²/(8·σ²)
with the standard reaction term −r. This allows assembly via the standard
axpyb() pattern with NO special off-diagonal manipulation.

IMPORTANT: The coefficient is r²h²/(8σ²), NOT r²h²/(16σ²).
The factor-of-2 arises because eq.(8) uses full ω at each time level.

Constructor signature:
  FdmCNVariantBlackScholesOp(
      ext::shared_ptr<FdmMesher> mesher,
      ext::shared_ptr<GeneralizedBlackScholesProcess> process,
      Real strike,
      bool localVol = false,
      Real illegalLocalVolOverwrite = -Null<Real>(),
      Size direction = 0,
      ext::shared_ptr<FdmQuantoHelper> quantoHelper
          = ext::shared_ptr<FdmQuantoHelper>());

The setTime() method:
  void FdmCNVariantBlackScholesOp::setTime(Time t1, Time t2) {
      // 1. Get r, q, vol exactly as FdmBlackScholesOp does
      // 2. Compute omega = -r / (16.0 * vol * vol)
      // 3. For each layout point i:
      //    a) Skip boundary nodes where dplus/dminus is Null<Real>()
      //    b) Compute h_i = 0.5*(dplus + dminus)
      //    c) Compute a_i = 0.5*vol*vol
      //    d) Compute b_i = (r - q) - a_i
      //    e) Compute effectiveDiffusion[i] = a_i + r*r*h_i*h_i/(8.0*vol*vol)
      //       NOTE: This is a_eff = σ²/2 + r²h²/(8σ²)
      //    f) Store: convection[i] = b_i
      // 4. Assemble via axpyb (STANDARD pattern — no custom off-diagonal):
      //    mapT_.axpyb(convection, dxMap_,
      //                dxxMap_.mult(effectiveDiffusion), Array(1, -r));
  }

Additional public methods:
  Real omega() const;                    // returns −r/(16σ²) last computed
  Real timestepConstraint() const;       // returns max safe Δt from CE-20

  // timestepConstraint() implements the log-space form:
  //   Δt_max = 1.0 / (a_eff_max/h_min² + r/2)
  //   where h_min is the MINIMUM effective spacing across all interior nodes,
  //   and a_eff_max is the corresponding effective diffusion at that node.
  //   Return Δt_max.
  //
  //   CAUTION: On concentrated meshes (e.g. near the strike), h_min can be
  //   extremely small, making Δt_max impractically tight. Users should monitor
  //   how many time steps this constraint implies and consider whether the
  //   mesh concentration is compatible with the CN variant scheme.

  bool mMatrixSatisfied() const;         // checks off-diagonal signs via
                                         // ModTripleBandLinearOp
  Size mMatrixViolationCount() const;

M-MATRIX ALGEBRAIC GUARANTEE (log-space form):
  The L_lower = a_eff/h² − b/(2h) ≥ 0 condition requires a_eff ≥ bh/2.
  Since a_eff = σ²/2 + r²h²/(8σ²) and the r²h²/(8σ²) term grows with h:
    For any h ≥ 4σ²/r (which is ~10⁻⁴ for σ=0.001, r=0.05),
    the M-matrix property is guaranteed. For h < 4σ²/r, the standard
    diffusion σ²/2 alone suffices (since bh/2 ≈ rh/2 < σ²/2 for small h).
  CONCLUSION: The CN variant's L operator satisfies the M-matrix condition
  for essentially ALL practical grid spacings.

=== FILE PAIR 2: FdmBarrierProjectionCondition ===

Path: ql/methods/finitedifferences/stepconditions/fdmbarrierprojectioncondition.hpp
      ql/methods/finitedifferences/stepconditions/fdmbarrierprojectioncondition.cpp

Implements the discrete barrier monitoring from CE-6:
  U_j ← U_j · 𝟙_{[L,U]}(S_j)

Constructor:
  FdmBarrierProjectionCondition(
      std::vector<Time> monitoringTimes,
      Real lowerBarrier,          // in S-space (NOT log-space); 0 means no lower
      Real upperBarrier,          // in S-space; Null<Real>() means no upper
      ext::shared_ptr<FdmMesher> mesher,
      Size direction = 0);

COORDINATE CONVERSION:
- The FdmBlackScholesMesher header comment says "1-d mesher for the
  Black-Scholes process (in ln(S))". So locations are x = ln(S).
- VERIFY from provided .cpp source before implementing. If mesher uses
  a different coordinate, STOP and ask.
- If x = ln(S): lnLower = log(lowerBarrier), lnUpper = log(upperBarrier)
- Precompute outsideIndices_ in constructor: vector of layout indices where
  location(iter, direction) < lnLower - tol OR > lnUpper + tol,
  with tol = 1e-12 for floating-point tolerance.

  void applyTo(Array& a, Time t) const override;
  // If t matches any monitoring time (within tolerance 1e-10), set a[i]=0
  // for all i in outsideIndices_. Otherwise no-op.

  const std::vector<Time>& monitoringTimes() const;

Edge cases:
- Empty monitoringTimes: constructor succeeds; applyTo always no-op
- lowerBarrier = 0: no lower barrier (only upper knockout)
- upperBarrier = Null<Real>(): no upper barrier (only lower knockout)

GRID ALIGNMENT NOTE:
  For accurate barrier enforcement, the barrier values ln(L) and ln(U) should
  ideally coincide with mesh points. The projection sets values to zero based
  on whether the mesh location falls outside [ln(L), ln(U)]. If a mesh point
  is slightly inside the barrier due to floating-point placement, the projection
  will NOT zero it, potentially leaving small residual values near the barrier.
  
  RECOMMENDATION: When constructing the mesher, add ln(L) and ln(U) as
  concentration points (if using Concentrating1dMesher), or verify post-hoc
  that the nearest mesh points are within tolerance of the barriers.

  off-diagonal manipulation, NO TripleBandLinearOp::add(), NO
  ModTripleBandLinearOp for assembly (only for diagnostic)
- The effective diffusion coefficient is a + r²h²/(8σ²), NOT /(16σ²)
- M-matrix diagnostic uses ModTripleBandLinearOp for read access
- FdmBarrierProjectionCondition correctly converts S-space barriers to
  ln(S) coordinates (VERIFIED from source, not assumed)
- outsideIndices_ computed once in constructor
- Use ext::shared_ptr throughout
